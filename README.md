Sinatra-Mindmapper
==================

A very WIP (web) mindmapping application. Probably shouldn't be used in production.

Built and used for mapping university lectures.

Built with Sinatra and DataMapper, uses the Raphael JS library for the main GUI.


Todo
----
* Remove hard-coded center cloud
* Make it possible to register users
* Better error prevention
* Fix up potential security holes
